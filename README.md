#Minions in Algebra Space
##Introduction 
Balance is everything, where there is ying, there should also be yang. Same applies to Minions and bananas. However the archenemy of Minions has attack the Banana republic and kidnapped the one and only Banana King.
And it all comes down to one Minion, HerpDerp, to save the Banana King from the cruel DeathCube.

###Normal level
During this level, there are three matrices: pre, result and post. The initial value of the pre and post matrices is an identity matrix. In the game, the value is represented as a number of blocks. The player starts on a start block on the result matrix and he/she needs to find the way to the spaceship to defeat the DeathCube boss for the glory of the Banana republic. 

The player has to use matrix multiplication to reach the spaceship, for example changing the pre and/or post matrices by adding or removing blocks will change the value of the result matrix. The minion can jump up to one block difference between the current and the next block on the result matrix, this does not apply for the pre and post matrices. Additionally the minion can pick up a banana item which increases the jump difference to two. After finding the spaceship, the player will be teleported to the next level.

###Boss level
After a number of normal levels, the player will reach the boss level. The boss is made out of blocks and one block is colored, this block is the initial block. The player has to shoot the initial block. After shooting the initial block, a vector appears on the top left part of the screen. Using this vector, the player has to find the right translated coordinate (block). If a wrong block is shot, then the game is over.
